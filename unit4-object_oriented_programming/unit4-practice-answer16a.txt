16.a. Whatâ€™re the purposes of the instance data member size, internally and externally?  

Answer:
'size' is a private helper in the 'ArrayList' class. It is declared on line 134:
It is used to initialize the length of the array, and can be found in some other methods 
including: trimToSize() line 180, and 'public void ensureCapacity(int minCapacity)' on line 194.
It is used externally with the method 'size()' on line 263 and that would be a public return of 'size'
